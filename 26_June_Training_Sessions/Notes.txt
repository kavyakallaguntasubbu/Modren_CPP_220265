        ->vector and C-style array
 
    2)Moce semantics
 
    3)RAII classes
 
    4)Git version control
 
    5)COmmand-line utilities
 
    6)How to interact with large scale projects
 
    7)recurssion and other styles of programming

to store
 
1) c-style array

    10      20      30

  0x100H   0X104H  0X108H

    ^

  arr
 
2)std::vector

   std::vector<int> data;
 
    10      20      30

  0x100H   0X104H  0X108H

   ^        ^       ^

   |        |       |
 
  [0x100H  | 0X108H | 120H]
 
3)std::list<T>

0x11H                     0x200H          0x800
nullptr|10 | 0x200H    0x11H|20|0x800  0x200H|30|nullptr

for consecutive elements

    from base-location to last element location (size -1)
        - access element as

            base address + (location * size of each element)

for linked list 

    from first location:
        - dereference to reach the element . access it
        - Now , read the address for next element.
        - if next pointer is nullptr , break.
        - else , repeat steps

    universal algorithm
    // ITERATORS are abstractors over pointers
    a) for every element fetched from the containers
        (DON'T GIVE A DAMN HOW YOU GET IT),
        - access the element and do something with it.
